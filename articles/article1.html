        <h2>Why do we still play FIFA?</h2>

                    The first FIFA game I played was FIFA 2000 and I loved it. That was an exceptionally long time ago though and like all relationships, it’s had its ups and downs.  Most of the problems over the years though were relatively minor and through each iteration there were some things to like and some things to loathe. Over the last couple of years though something far more sinister has been occurring and it really makes me question why I keep returning to these games.
                    <br><br>
                    If you’re a fan of the series, then you’ve probably guessed that I’m referring to the money-printing machine that is FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT). My first foray into this mode was in FIFA 20, well after its first appearance as a downloadable expansion for FIFA 09. As an adult gamer I have learned to dislike the kinds of sweaty, multiplayer arenas that are so central to modes like FUT.  So I ignored it and continued my merry path of helping teams from League 2 reach the pinnacle of European Football in the often maligned Career Mode. Over time though it became clear to me that the focus of Electronic Arts (EA) was to develop FUT and so I begrudgingly entered the fray.
                    <br><br>
                    For those of you who haven’t tried it, when you start out you are given a team of also-rans who are barely able to kick a ball. Depending on the difficulty level you play at this might be good enough to beat most of the AI controlled teams you come up against, but you very quickly come to realise that your team is going to need some major upgrades. The good news is that the generous overlords at EA have provided us with several ways to do this for free. We could play against other human players; but with a beginner squad this is more like throwing time straight down the toilet. Or we can play modes like “Squad Battles” against the AI. Certainly, this is the recommended route for any newbies out there. But here’s the rub. With each game you get a certain number of coins depending on how you do, for arguments sake let’s say it’s an average of 400. According to futbin.com, the most expensive player to purchase currently will cost you 8.5 million coins. If we ignore things like trading and other bonuses (because there are too many variables to account for) then we come to 21,250 games that need to be played to afford that one player. If each game takes you about 15 minutes to complete, then in order to buy that player, you’ll need to play for over 221 days non-stop. 
                    <br><br>
                    Okay so that example is an extreme one and yes there are ways to supplement the amount of coins you earn with bonuses, but in reality, the only way to get a competitive team is to pay for it. Not just with your time but with real-world cash. A survey by Bleacher Report Football showed that out of around 1,500 FIFA players surveyed, 38% admitted to spending some form of real-world money. One user even estimated that they’d spent around $280,000 over a decade. So you’d probably assume that each year this player has a huge advantage over the rest right? Wrong, every year another FIFA game comes out, everyone starts from scratch and that $280,000 becomes completely worthless.
                    <br><br>
                    Cards on the table though I have to admit that I’m in that 38%. I got sucked into the grind for better player cards and spent way too many hours playing my way to earn more packs. But what other options do fans have? The days since PES was a genuine rival to FIFA seem like a distant memory and there are certainly no future rivals to the crown anywhere on the horizon. As such it is safe to assume that the FIFA money-train is going to keep on rolling down the track and we’ll continue to stoke the fires with our hard-earned cash. As football fans we are exploited in many different ways for our devotion to the game we love, FIFA is just another example. Unfortunately I don’t see that changing any time soon but I sure wish it would. Imagine a world where fans are rewarded for their loyalty instead of exploited, wouldn’t that be something?
