                    While the attempt to create a European Super League failed, it certainly succeeded in raising tensions. Aspects of the game which had been a niggling worry at the back of a lot of people’s minds were suddenly pushed to the fore and the sport is now under more scrutiny than it has been for a very long time. Arguably the biggest of those questions is around how teams are financing their operations. It is easy to look at the owners of those major clubs and focus solely on the greed that was undoubtedly at play, but another aspect to consider is the enormous amounts of debt their clubs have against them. FC Barcelona for example are well known for their financial issues, which according to a report in <a href="https://www.elmundo.es/deportes/futbol/primera-division/2021/01/25/600f103e21efa0aa318b4584.html" alt="" target="_blank">El Mundo</a> in January amounted to over €1 billion in debt.
                    <br><br>
                    One thing is for sure, these guys are all good business men and one thing business men don’t like doing is spending money they don’t have to. The reality of their current circumstances is that in order to stay competitive, they’ve had to shell out increasingly huge sums of money on player transfers and wages. As fans we’d all love our clubs to be financially secure but then a transfer window opens and we’re all online drinking up every juicy transfer rumour and wishing our club could spend hundreds of millions to purchase the next Messi or Ronaldo. If the money were in our hands, what would we do?
                    <br><br>
                    Taking the Premier League as an example, the estimated total salary output on players in the 2020/2021 season exceeded £1.3 billion or €1.5 billion. The salaries can vary hugely from player to player but with 557 squad players in the league, that averages out to around £2.3 million per player. Probably the closest sport in terms of wages is the NFL and they usually quote around $2 million per player or around  £1.4 million.
                    <br><br>
                    The NFL’s salary cap structure is pretty complicated, but a short summary would be that there are three levels: a hard cap, soft cap and salary floor. A hard cap is a maximum amount that may not be exceeded for any reason. A soft cap is one that can be exceeded in certain circumstances but may incur a penalty. Lastly, a salary floor is a minimum that must be spent on the team as a whole.  The maximum team salary varies each year based on the league’s revenues but in 2021 it was $182.5 million.
                    <br><br>
                    So why not implement something like this in football? Well, there are many reasons, but let’s focus on some of the main ones…
                    <br><br>
                    Firstly, the NFL is pretty much the one and only league for top level “American Football”. Europe has the top five leagues in England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, as well as numerous other elite football leagues. That’s not even to mention the other leagues vying for that elite status on other continents. Take for example the enormous wages being paid in China to develop their league. So to implement a salary cap would require agreement from most, if not all of these leagues. Something that the doomed Super League proved is very difficult to achieve.
                    <br><br>
                    Secondly, increasing revenue (as has been the case with television rights into football) always prompts an argument about who this is thanks to. The players would make the argument, with some merit, that the quality of football wouldn’t be what it is without them and so they should receive a bigger portion of the revenue. It goes without saying that the sport wouldn’t be what it is without the fans, but being realistic, the fans will always be the benefactors, not the beneficiaries. So that leaves the clubs. I have no doubt that the owners would love to know player salaries were being capped but I find it inconceivable that the players (and more likely, their agents) would take that lying down.
                    <br><br>
                    Thirdly, if we tried to borrow from the NFL system and took a percentage of the revenue generated by each league to determine a salary cap, this would more or less guarantee the continued success of the current top leagues while ensuring the other leagues were pretty much stuck where they are. Conversely, if a salary cap was set somewhere around what the middle-tier leagues could more reasonably afford, this would ensure competitiveness, but the top leagues want to attract all the top talent to ensure their TV audiences,  so they’ll never give up this advantage.
                    <br><br>
                    From a fan perspective, salary caps would undoubtedly be a good thing in football. It would go a long way to ensuring the financial stability and longevity of our clubs and promote competitiveness throughout the leagues. Sure we want the best players at our club, but if we can’t get them, in the words of Luther Vandross, we’ll love the ones we’re with. However, it seems an insurmountable challenge that all the other parties necessary to achieve this very commendable goal, would ever agree on the point.
