                        <h3>Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United agree a fee in principle for Jadon Sancho</h3>
                        <p>
                            The fee, believed to be around £73 million is expected to be a five-year deal, payable over five equal instalments. Dortmund had been resistant to this term and had preferred a deal over four years, however the risk of losing more money by not agreeing a deal this Summer appears to have been enough to persuade the Bundesliga side to part ways with one of their top performers.

                                United fans will be delighted to see one of Europe’s top young talents join the club and will be able to look forward to next season with great anticipation. Not only does Sancho’s age mean that United will get good value from the length of his time at the club, but it also means that Sancho’s best years are still ahead of him. Having scored 50 goals and registering 57 assists in 137 appearances at Dortmund, the idea that Sancho still has room to improve is frankly frightening.
                                <br><br>
                                While this is good news for United, it will also be good news to Gareth Southgate. The England Manager has been reluctant to throw Sancho into the mix so far at the Euros but looking ahead to future tournaments, if Sancho performs well, it will give Southgate the opportunity to see Sancho playing alongside a lot more of his England teammates.

                        <h3>Rafael Benitez appointed as Everton Manager</h3>
                        <p>
                            Everton FC have announced the appointment of Rafael Benitez as their new Manager. This is undoubtedly a controversial move for the Toffees who had been shocked at the end of last season when it was revealed their manager at the time (Carlo Ancelotti) would be leaving after only 18 months in charge. While 2020/2021 wasn’t the most glittering of seasons, with a mid-table finish in 10th place, there had still been a feeling of optimism with the Italian at the helm. Now a different wave of emotions is likely to come crashing over Everton fans.
                            <br><br>
                            <span class="read-more-text">
                                The Spaniard’s connections to Liverpool FC will not be forgotten quickly and it provides Benitez with a steep hill to climb right from the off. He will need to get positive results on the board quickly if he’s going to have any chance of convincing Everton fans that he’s the man for the job. 
                                <br><br>
                                These concerns however will be unlikely to phase a manager with so much experience. Having started his coaching career at the age of 26 with Real Madrid, Benitez has gone on to coach at a number of top European clubs and certainly isn’t a stranger to entering what will undoubtedly be a pressure cooker of an environment, like the one he’ll be greeted with at Goodison Park.
                                <br><br>
                                One aspect which fans might not like, but could work in Everton’s favour, is that players tend not to care as much nowadays about local rivalries, since most of them don’t come from the area. As fans we passionately love our clubs and the idea of a once-rival manager taking charge is almost too much to bare. But the players are professionals and Benitez has a trophy cabinet full of silverware that should give the Toffees fans a reason to feel like this might not be such a bad move after all.

                <h3>England defeat Germany to progress to quarter finals</h3>
                <p>
                    In what was surely the most important game of Gareth Southgate's tenure as England Manager, his side delivered for him in spades. The pressure was on the team with a lacklustre showing in the group stages and many pundits had prophesied doom on the team before this game. However Gareth’s cool and calm demeanour throughout this tournament, has spoken volumes about a manager who will not be worried by the criticism of those outside his team. 
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="read-more-text">
                        The biggest question going into this game was whether the ever-pragmatic Southgate might take the shackles off his players and set them out in a more attacking formation. Once the team sheets were out though it was clear that his intention was to match the Germans in their formation man for man, and focus his tactics on nullifying their opponents. For all the Southgate detractors out there (and I’ve been one of them), the formation was spot-on and the Germans posed little threat throughout the game. With the exception of Sterling’s misplaced pass which gave Muller a chance on goal, England’s opponents were limited to a handful of shots, despite boasting the talented Chelsea pair of Timo Werner and an excellent Kai Havertz.  
                        <br><br>
                        At times when playing three at the back, England have looked stuffy, slow and bereft of ideas going forwards. This game was a massive improvement and certainly the Team looked a lot more comfortable in the formation than they had done in the lead up to the tournament. The biggest improvement has been in the midfield. Phillips and Rice were dominant in the centre of the park and provided an excellent fulcrum around which all of England’s other good work was able to take place. In previous games the pair had looked slightly lost at times or were simply outnumbered; but on this occasion they were assured and confident.
                        <br><br>
                        No doubt the man of the match was Raheem Sterling. As someone who (bar Jordan Pickford) has probably taken the largest amount of flack from England fans over the last few years, he has turned up to this Tournament in a big way. Apart from scoring in three out of four games so far, he has looked dangerous in every game and when he gets the ball there is a sense that he’s going to do something positive. He’s been sharp, cutting in from the left, but when he switched to the right, he looked even more dangerous. Southgate will be tempted to keep the same starting line-up for the next game, but what we saw here was a balance with Sterling on the right and Grealish on the left that could seriously cause teams a lot of problems.
                        <br><br>
                        There were many more positives for Gareth to take out of the night but probably the biggest thing will be the vindication of his management strategy. So many people called for more attacking play and derided Gareth as being too negative. On this night though he did something no other England manager has done for fifty-five years and guided his team to defeat the Germans at a major tournament in the knock-out stages. Criticise him now at your peril.

                <h3>Patson Daka signs for Leicester City</h3>
                <p>
                    Leicester have signed one of the hottest players in the transfer window. The 22-year-old Zambian striker had been linked with a number of clubs, including Liverpool as recently as last week. However the Foxes have managed to secure the services of Patson Daka, who scored 27 goals in 28 appearances last season, for what seems nowadays to be a very good price at £22 million.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="read-more-text">
                        The five-year deal will see him end his time with the talent factory over at RB Salzburg, where his performances last season saw him named the Austrian Bundesliga’s player of the season. He told LCFC TV “I have followed Leicester from the time they won the league. I feel it is the perfect place for me, because it’s a team that fights for titles. I know it’s not going to be easy, but I feel ready to face this new challenge.”
                        <br><br>
                        Daka also comes with International experience, having featured 22 times at senior level for his country and scoring seven goals. In 2017 he was named African Football’s Young Player of the Year.
                        <br><br>
                        Jamie Vardy has long been the main goal-scorer at Leicester and this move isn’t likely to change that, but Brendan Rogers will be pleased to have a few more options up front.

            <h3>Why do we still play FIFA?</h3>
            <p class=article-text>The first FIFA game I played was FIFA 2000 and I loved it. That was an exceptionally long time ago though and like all relationships, it’s had its ups and downs.  Most of the problems over the years though were relatively minor and through each iteration there were some things to like and some things to loathe. Over the last couple of years though something far more sinister has been occurring and it really makes me question why I keep returning to these games.</p>

            <h3>Can salary caps save football?</h3>
            <p class=article-text>While the attempt to create a European Super League failed, it certainly succeeded in raising tensions. Aspects of the game which had been a niggling worry at the back of a lot of people’s minds were suddenly pushed to the fore and the sport is now under more scrutiny than it has been for a very long time. Arguably the biggest of those questions is around how teams are financing their operations. It is easy to look at the owners of those major clubs and focus solely on the greed that was undoubtedly at play, but another aspect to consider is the enormous amounts of debt their clubs have against them. FC Barcelona for example are well known for their financial issues, which according to a report in <a href="https://www.elmundo.es/deportes/futbol/primera-division/2021/01/25/600f103e21efa0aa318b4584.html" alt=""  target="_blank">El Mundo</a> in January amounted to over €1 billion in debt.</p>
